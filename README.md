# Spotify-API-
Work in progress application that will be used to output song cover onto a rgb matrix. 


As of right now the application can get the song that is currently playing on one's Spotify account and output it to the console in real time. A jpg is also updated with the cover of the song. I plan on acquiring a Raspberyy pi and rbg matrix to make a decoration out of it, but supply chain issues prevent me from doing so. 


This application should work as long as you update client id and secret id with one that corresponds with your spotify account.
